# Algorand School
Algorand School is an open slide deck I've built over time during my talks on 
Algorand's blockchain with the help of Algorand colleagues.

The goal of the deck is providing a step-by-step introduction to Algorand's 
technology, ecosystem and tools, in order to lower the learning curve difficulty 
and speed up the learning process. 

Main topics of the Algorand School:

- 🕸 Understanding Algorand Consensus and Algorand Networks
- 🛠 Familiarizing with the Algorand Nodes and Dev Tools
- 🤝 Shedding light on Algorand's features (Account, Transactions, ASAs, etc.)
- 🤖 Clarifying how to develop dApps on the Algorand Virtual Machine

### Contents
1. Blockchain as an infrastructure
2. Analog properties for Digital things
3. Algorand Consensus
4. Algorand Sustainability
5. Algorand Networks
6. Algorand Interoperability
7. Algorand Transactions
8. Algorand Accounts
9. Algorand Standard Assets
10. Algorand Virtual Machine
11. Algorand Smart Contracts on Layer-1
12. Smart Signatures & Smart Contracts
13. TEAL
14. PyTEAL (credits to [@jasonpaulos](https://github.com/jasonpaulos) and [@matteojug](https://github.com/matteojug))
15. Algorand ABI (credits to [@deanstef](https://github.com/deanstef))
16. Beaker (credits to [@iskysun96](https://github.com/iskysun96))

#### Note
Almost all the contents presented in the Algorand School derive directly from 
the [Algorand Developer Portal](https://developer.algorand.org/), which 
remains the first and most important source of information about Algorand.

## Contibuting with translations (PR)
Would you like to contribute to the Algorand's educational cause? Help me with 
the translation!

Just follow the translations guidelines:
1. Fork this repo
2. Copy and rename `algorand-school-english.txt` into `algorand-school-<language>.txt`
3. Add your translations for each text fields, in **addition** to the English one
4. Do not translate acronyms and abbreviations (e.g. _AVM_, _VRF_, etc.)
5. Do not translate `code` sections
6. Always start a translated text field with `#`
7. Do not skip slides while translating
8. Submit a PR

Example of editing `algorand-school-italian.txt`:
```
What is a blockchain?
# Cos'è una blockchain?
5
A blockchain is a public ledger of transactional data, distributed across a system of multiple nodes in a network.
# Una blockchain è un registro pubblico di dati transazionali, distribuito su un sistema di molteplici nodi in una rete.
```

I will review the translation, merge it into presentation's source file and 
publish the PDF once the translation is finalized.

All the translators will be included into the `Credits` slide.

## Errata corrige (Issue)
Did you catch and error, a typo or any type of misinformation? Please open an **Issue** indicating:

1. 🎲 The slide number
2. 😓 The error
3. 💡 A suggestion for a correction

All the contributors will be included into the `Credits` slide.
